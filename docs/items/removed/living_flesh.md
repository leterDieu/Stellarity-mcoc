# Living Flesh (Old)

<div markdown class="kohara-infobox-text">
**Living Flesh** was a consumable item which provided extreme healing when eaten, but in return severely weakened the player for a short time.

## Obtaining
1 - 8 Living Flesh could be found inside of chests in [End Dungeons](../../structures/end_dungeon.md).

Alternatively, [void fishing](../../mechanics/void_fishing.md) in the Flesh Tundra could yield 2 - 6 per catch, and there was also a 70% chance for a Hematic Crate to contain 1 - 2 Living Flesh.

## Usage
After eating Living Flesh, players would get Regeneration VII for 3 seconds, which healed a total of 60:heart: x ₃₀ health. However, players would also be inflicted with a decaying Weakness effect for 30 seconds - 15 seconds of Weakness II, fading into 15 seconds of Weakness I.

## Trivia
- This was one of the first items to have ever been added to Stellarity.
