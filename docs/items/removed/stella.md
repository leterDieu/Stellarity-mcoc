# Stella

<div class="result kohara-infobox-grid" markdown>
<div markdown class="kohara-infobox-text">
**Stella** was a post-Empress sword which applied Prismatic Inferno on hit. Unlike most DoT inflicting weapons, Stella could stack the damage of its flames up to 5 times and they lasted longer.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanting-table"></i> Stella could be enchanted with any Sword enchantment.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> Stella could be repaired with <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-netherite-ingot"></i>Netherite Ingots.

## Obtaining
Stella had a 33% chance to be dropped by the Empress of Light, but only if killed in The End or in the Overworld during nighttime.

## Usage
Enemies attacked with Stella were set on Prismatic Inferno for 4 seconds. However, this effect could be stacked up to 5 times, multiplying total damage. Hitting enemies with 5 stacks refreshed the effect.

## History
=== "**v2.1a**"
	- :fire: Removed and replaced with [Prismember](../prismember.md)

=== "**v2.0c**"
	- :red_circle: Reduced the duration of Prismatic Inferno (5s -> 4s).
	- :red_circle: Indirectly nerfed through nerf to Prismatic Inferno (effect no longer has 30% armor penetration).
	- :bug: Fixed Stella sometimes applying 2 stacks of Prismatic Inferno at once.
	- :bug: Fixed stack amount being capped at 4 rather than 5 as intended.
	- Added sounds on attacks, improved Inferno particles based on the amount of stacks.

=== "**v2.0a**"
    - :rocket: Introduced.
