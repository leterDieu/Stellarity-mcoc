# Sharanga

<div class="result kohara-infobox-grid" markdown>
<div markdown class="kohara-infobox-text">
**Sharanga** is a pre-Dragon bow which converts <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows into Spectral Bolts. They travel faster, deal more damage and are unaffected by gravity.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanting-table"></i> Sharanga can be enchanted with any Bow enchantment.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> Sharanga can be repaired by fusing it with a different <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-bow"></i>Bow.

## Obtaining
Sharanga has a 9% chance to be dropped by Illusioners in [Strongholds](../structures/stronghold.md). Each level of Looting increases the odds by 3%, up to a total of 18% with Looting III. 

It drops paired with 7 - 22 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows.

## Usage
When using <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows as ammunition, they are converted into high velocity Spectral Bolts. Bolts deal 30% more damage and fly 30% faster and in a straight line. They can also pierce up to 4 mobs, dissipating upon hitting the 5th.

Sharanga has a 25% chance to not use up fired <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows. This chance is doubled by the Infinity enchantment for a total of 50%.

## Tips
- Bolts always disappear after either hitting a block or after 3 seconds have passed, not after travelling a set distance.
- Sharanga enchanted with Infinity is superior to one enchanted with Mending due to increased chance of conserving <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows.
- Skeletons in The End drop <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-spectral-arrow"></i>Spectral Arrows on death while being inflicted with Glowing, meaning that setting up a mob farm there could be a really good way to get the special ammunition for Sharanga.

## Trivia
- This is the first ranged weapon to ever be added into Stellarity.
- Prior to v2.1a, Bolts would explode in a small radius when expiring or when coming into contacts with a non-solid block, dealing 66% of Arrow's __base__ damage with 20% armor penetration.
    - Additionally, prior to 2.0a, explosions didn't have any armor penetration and dealt flat 10 damage.
- The End Rod particles which spin around the Spectral Bolts always spin clockwise.
