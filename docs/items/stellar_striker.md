## Obtaining
Cheat

## Usage
When you hold the Stellar Striker out, stars build up. One appears every 6 seconds, with a max of 5 stars. When you crouch and attack, a star is released, dealing 12 :heart: x 6 damage with 8 :heart::heart::heart::heart: of the damage being splash. Both direct hit and splash damage have 40% armor penetration.

the Casket of stars exists but who cares about that thing its not only unobtainable but its also gonna get removed

## Tips
- This weapon would be best to use at range, to make full use of the range advantage from the stars
- Using this against high defense enemies will be recommended, due to the good damage you can build up mixed with armor penetration.

## Trivia
- Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
